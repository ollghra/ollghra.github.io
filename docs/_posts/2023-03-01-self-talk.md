### Self talk
Where did all the good time go?  
There's nothing here,  
 nothing now but  
Snow  
Settling on my head.  

I saw a man talk yesterday about something.  
A thing with swallows  
Or  
Was it turtles?  
It was good.  

No. Not this again.  
I don't want to.  
The world is this and this is shit.  
Give me mountains again.  

And air, open air  
Where I might imagine a falcon  
And think myself free.  

I did this, I chose this.  
Not all at once in a step into the dark  
But by searing inches the knife slipped in and my life slipped out.  

Up now.  
You're  
Being  
A  
Bitch.

Back to work.
