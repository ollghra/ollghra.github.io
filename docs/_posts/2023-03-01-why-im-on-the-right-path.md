# Why I'm on the right path (and you're not)

While walking yesterday, a man stopped me and asked: "how can I stop being so unproductive?"
He tried to explain what that meant, but by my questioning, became enlightened and transcended this plane on the spot.

## A reasonable standard for productivity

I wake up every morning before I've gone to sleep.
I get sixteen hours of deep work in every day and run a marathon every night.
I recover by dreaming of sleep and sniffing protein powder.

I'm so productive that I generate time from nothing; on a good day I work at the rate of ten seconds per second, and all my days are good.
I cheer up depression, I don't feel recession, I am more metal than man.
My task tracker is a looped recording of a racecar passing at full speed.

## Family, relationships
I am your mother's favourite nephew without even being related.
I'm the one she wishes she could compare you to, but it would crush your spirit.

I can answer emails, write code, do surgery and bake the best scones your mam's ever tasted, all while having more time for the people in my life, more fun doing what I love, more money than anyone else could dream of spending.

## Diet, morality
I only eat responsibly sourced, cruelty-free, parsnip-infused meat and veg. No carbs, no carbon, no chemtrails.
I fuel my body exclusively with ice cubes and low-fat, high-protein, no-craic smoothies.

## How to deal with the internet

I'm not a hermit in the woods, I'm online. If I were a hermit, the forest would feel lonely and the trees would go hungry.

When I read an article, it fact checks itself. 
My background checks are so detailed that the head of the shadow government wrote in his diary that he wished I'd stop.
I summarised the internet in 2008 and used to keep it on a sheet of paper floating in the wind.
I updated the summary by shouting at butterflies; their wings flap and dirt combines with moisture to stain the paper with new words.
This method was too unwieldy, too many middlemen. Now I keep it in the rustlings of leaves Siberia, I just blow in a certain way to alter global wind patterns and the data self-updates.

I switch contexts so fast that Instagram gets ADD.

## Congratulations on your enlightenment

If you've taken in the lessons above, you're now in Nirvana. Congratulations!

If not, you're clearly proficient at being deficient. Congratulations!
